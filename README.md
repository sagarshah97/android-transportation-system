- The Transportation System project in Kotlin is designed to model a transportation system that includes various modes of transportation, such as trains, taxis, and buses.
- Transportation systems are complex networks that facilitate the movement of people and goods. The purpose of this project is to understand the basic
components of a transportation system and their interactions within the system.
- This project helps in visualizing how different modes of transportation function in harmony to enable an individual to reach from source to destination.
- The project's primary objectives are to create an abstract base class to represent common attributes shared by all types of transportation, implement child classes that represent a specific type of transportation, define constructors, getter-setter methods, and validation logic to ensure data integrity and
establish a relationship amongst these components to simulate a transportation system.

##  ![Functionalities](https://api.iconify.design/pajamas/requirements.svg?height=28&color=%23ba3329) Functionalities

Train Functionality:
1. Journey Initiation: Trains can initiate journeys with information about their route, passenger capacity, and speed. Passengers and cargo can be transported efficiently on predefined routes.<br/>
2. Capacity and Speed Control: Train instances provide control over passenger capacity and speed, ensuring they meet specific requirements for each journey. These attributes can be adjusted as needed.

Bus Functionality:
1. Route Management: Buses can start specific routes with details about their route number and passenger capacity. They play a crucial role in public transportation systems.<br/>
2. Passenger Capacity Adjustment: Bus instances allow for the adjustment of passenger capacity, accommodating varying numbers of passengers based on demand and regulations.

Taxi Functionality:
1. Ride Initiation: Taxis can start rides, providing information about their driver, license plate, and route. Taxis serve as on-demand transportation for individuals or small groups.<br/>
2. Route and Driver Details: Taxi instances include driver details and license plate information, essential for passenger safety and identification during rides.
